# univ-rankings
University Rankings was a project centered around file navigation. The program would read the files containing the information, gather the information required, then print it in an empty text file which will contain the output. For loops were used to read through all the lines in the files, each line being split into lists so the functions could gather the keywords (the key info) located in each line.

TopUni.csv is a sample file provided by the university
